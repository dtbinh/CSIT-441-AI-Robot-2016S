Place the extracted file in a folder to hold long term
I use $USER\bin\ but where ever you prefer will work
You will need to uncompress the source files for ev3classes and dbus

Open the project structure menu
Move to the modules tab
On the far right click "Add Content Root"
Move to your files you uncompressed
add /lib/ev3/
Main should no longer show as an error
